  "readme": "Minifyify\n=========\n#### Tiny, Debuggable Browserify Bundles\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ben-ng/minifyify.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ben-ng/minifyify)\n\n*Now with Browserify 4 & CoffeeScript support*\n\nBefore, browserify made you choose between sane debugging and sane load times. Now, you can have both.\n\nMinifyify is a browserify plugin that minifies your code. The magic? The sourcemap points back to the original, separate source files.\n\nNow you can deploy a minified bundle in production, and still have a sourcemap handy for when things inevitably break!\n\n## Usage\n\n### Programmatic API\n```js\nvar browserify = require('browserify')\n  , bundler = new browserify();\n\nbundler.add('entry.js');\n\nbundler.plugin('minifyify', {map: 'bundle.map.json'});\n\nbundler.bundle(function (err, src, map) {\n  // Your code here\n});\n```\n\nThe map option should be the location of the sourcemap on your server, and is used to insert the `sourceMappingURL` comment in `src`.\n\n### Command Line\n```sh\n$ browserify entry.js -p [minifyify --map bundle.map.json --output bundle.map.json] > bundle.js\n```\n\nThe `--output` option is a required option on the command line interface and specifies where minifyify should write the sourcemap to on disk.\n\n## Options\n\n### [options.compressPath]\n\nShorten the paths you see in the web inspector by defining a compression function.\n\n```\n// A typical compressPath function\ncompressPath: function (p) {\n  return path.relative('my-app-root', p);\n}\n```\n\nIf a string is provided, it will be used instead of `my-app-root` in the function above. This is useful if you are working from the command line and cannot define a function.\n\nDefaults to a no-op (absolute paths to all source files).\n\n### [options.map]\n\nThis is added to the bottom of the minified source file, and should point to where the map will be accessible from on your server. [More details here](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/#toc-howwork).\n\nExample: If your bundle is at `mysite.com/bundle.js` and the map is at `mysite.com/map.js`, set `options.map = '/map.js'`\n\nSet to `false` to minify, but not produce a source map or append the source map URL comment.\n\n### [options.minify]\n\nSet to false to disable minification and source map transforms. This essentially turns minifyify into a pass-thru stream.\n\nIf you set it to an object, it will be passed as the options argument to `uglify.minify`.\n\n### [options.output]\n\nSpecify a path to write the sourcemap to. Required when using the CLI, optional when working programmatically.\n\n## FAQ\n\n * PARSE ERROR!\n\n   Are you using `brfs`? Pin it to version `1.0.2`. See issue #44 for details.\n\n * Wait.. Why did the total size (souce code + map) get BIGGER??\n\n   It's not immediately obvious, but the more you minify code, the bigger the sourcemap gets. Browserify can get away with merely mapping lines to lines because it is going from uncompressed code to uncompressed code. Minifyify squishes multiple lines together, so the sourcemap has to carry more information.\n\n   This is OK because the sourcemap is in a separate file, which means your app will be snappy for your users as their browsers won't download the sourcemap.\n\n * How does this work?\n\n   Minifyify runs UglifyJS on each file in your bundle, and transforms browserify's sourcemap to map to the original files.\n\n * Why does the sourcemap cause my debugger to behave erratically?\n\n   Some of the optimizations UglifyJS performs will result in sourcemaps that appear to broken. For example, when UglifyJS uses the comma operator to shorten statements on different lines, a single debugger \"step\" in minified code may execute multiple lines of the original source.\n\n   Another common example of erratic behavior is when code like this is compressed:\n\n   ```\n   var myThing = myFunc('a')\n     , cantGetHere = myFunc('b');\n   ```\n\n   If you set a breakpoint on the second line, your debugger might not pause execution there. I've found that setting the breakpoint on the first line and stepping onto the second line is more reliable.\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2014 Ben Ng\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
